The syntax for the "alphabet" command is as follows:

	alphabet <new> <alphabet1> [alphabet2] ... [alphabetN] <old>

The alphabet of the resulting automaton <new> is set to the input alphabets, and all invalid transitions are removed from the new automaton.

The number of alphabets in the command must equal to the number of input alphabets of the <old> automaton.

For example, if "aut" (saved in "Automata Library/") has the alphabets "msd_2 msd_2 msd_fib", to set its alphabets to "msd_fib msd_fib msd_4", one writes

	alphabet res msd_2 msd_2 msd_fib aut;

The resulting automaton "res" is saved in "Automata Library/".
